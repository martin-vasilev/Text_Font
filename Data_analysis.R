# sub:              Subject number
# item:             Item (sentence) number from the corpus file
# cond:             Condition number (1= small font short line; 2= big font short line; 3= small font long line; 
#                                     4= big font long line)
# seq:              Trial sequence, or the order in which trials were presented in the experiment
# trialStart:       Start of trial time stamp in raw asc file
# SFIX:             Start of fixation flag in the asc data (search for it in raw data to quickly locate it)
# EFIX:             End of fixation flag in the asc data (search for it in raw data to quickly locate it)
# xPos:             X position of the fixation on the screen
# yPos:             Y position of the fixation on the screen
# fix_num:          Fixation number in the current trial
# fix_dur:          Fixation duration (in ms)
# sacc_dur:         Incoming saccade duration (in ms)
# line:             Line of text on which the fixation occured
# word:             Word number in the trial on which the fixation occured
# char_trial:       Character number in the trial on which the fixation occured (includes all text in the trial)
# char_line:        Character number on the current line on which the fixation occured (each line starts at 0)
# prevChar:         Character number (line) on which the previous fixation occured
# nextChar:         Character number (line) on which the next fixation occured
# prevX:            X position on which the previous fixation occured
# nextX:            X position on which the next fixation occured
# regress:          A logical indicating whether the current fixation is a regressive one (1= yes; 0= no)
# wordID:           A string of the word on which the fixation occured
# land_pos:         Landing position in characters on the current word (0= empty space before word)
# sacc_len:         Incoming saccade length (in characters)
# outsideText:      A logical indicating whether the current fixation occured outside the text area (1= yes; 0=no)
# max_char_line:    Maximum number of characters on the current line
# Rtn_sweep:        A logical indicating whether the current fixation is a return sweep one (1= yes; 0= no)
# Rtn_sweep_type:   Type of return sweep saccade ("undersweep" or "accurate")
# LandStartLet:     Landing position relative to the start of the line in letters (equivalent to char_line)
# LandStartVA:      Landing position relative to the start of the line in degrees per visual angle
# undersweep_prob:  A logical indicating whether the current fixation is an undersweep one (1= yes; 0=no)
# launchDistLet:    Launch site distance in letters (equivalent to sacc_len)
# launchDistVA:     Launch site distance in degrees per visual angle


# Please note: counting in the present data (e.g., fixation/ character/ line numbers) always starts at 1.
